# Real Estate Price Prediction Model

## Overview

**RealEstateAI Solutions** aims to enhance the valuation of property prices by using advanced regularization techniques in linear regression models. The goal is to provide more accurate and reliable price predictions while minimizing overfitting and improving the model's generalization capabilities.

## Problem Statement

In the real estate sector, precise price estimations are critical for informed decision-making. Traditional linear regression models can suffer from overfitting, reducing their predictive accuracy. Therefore, this project explores effective regularization methods to improve predictive performance and manage model complexity.

## Approach

This notebook implements and compares several regularization methods:

* **Lasso Regression**
* **Ridge Regression**
* **Elastic Net**

These methods are applied to develop a robust system that delivers stable and accurate real estate price predictions. This assists real estate agents and investors in making data-driven decisions, enhancing their competitiveness in the market.
